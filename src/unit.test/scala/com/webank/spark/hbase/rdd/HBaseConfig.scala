 * - from a sequence of String key/value pairs
 * - from an existing object with a `rootdir` and `quorum` members
 *
 * The two latter cases are provided for simplicity
 * (ideally a client should not have to deal with the native
 * HBase API).
 *
 * The last constructor contains the minimum information to
 * be able to read and write to the HBase cluster. It can be used
 * in tandem with a case class containing job configuration.
